How to build a new package:
0. Make sure your requirements are met:

   - Good stuff like dpkg-dev and devscripts are installed.
   - You have a GPG key ready to go for package signing.
   - You may need to set DEBEMAIL and DEBFULLNAME in your environment.

1. Create or fetch a pristine release tarball, for example if using git:

   git archive --format=tar --prefix=coil-0.3.20/ HEAD \
       | gzip > ../coil_0.3.20.orig.tar.gz

   Note: setup.py sdist won't include everything from the repository.

2. Make sure your checkout is also pristine or at least only includes
   changes you want to release which will be contained in the source diff.

3. Run debchange to add a new changelog entry:

   debchange -v 0.3.20-1

4. Build and sign the package!

   debuild -i'^\.git/' -sa
